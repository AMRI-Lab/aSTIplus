# aSTIplus: Regularized Susceptibility Tensor Imaging With Asymmetry Constraint in the Human Brain in vivo
ASTI+ is a new proposed STI reconstruction method for human brain in vivo. 

ASTI+ improves in vivo STI reconstruction by relaxing the symmetry constraint, adding isotropic susceptibility regularization to CSF region and morphology constraint to white matter region.

This repository contains implementations of Fc-aSTI model for simulated data and in vivo human brain data.
